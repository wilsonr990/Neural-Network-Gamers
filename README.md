# Neural-network-players
Java program that uses a genetic algorithm to train players that play multiple games.

I based this project on what I found was a working network to train snakes for an specific game. IÂ´m just intending to learn and apply my new knowlodge in
what I like. My main objective is to enforce my current Chocomoucher project and to do players for games presented in www.codingame.com!

The first steps will be part of a refactoring oriented to my project Chocomoucher to behave similarly with Games and Players separated.

Controls stills the same for now:

a:       pause simulation
b:       resume simulation
c:       show stats
d:       hide stats
space:   watch best snake and its neural network
